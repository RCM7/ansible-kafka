# The connect string for the controller quorum
controller.quorum.voters={{ kafka_controller_quorum_voters }}

############################# Socket Server Settings #############################

# The address the socket server listens on.
# Combined nodes (i.e. those with `process.roles=broker,controller`) must list the controller listener here at a minimum.
# If the broker listener is not defined, the default listener will use a host name that is equal to the value of java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName(),
# with PLAINTEXT listener name, and port 9092.
#   FORMAT:
#     listeners = listener_name://host_name:port
#   EXAMPLE:
#     listeners = PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092
listeners={{ kafka_listeners | join(",")}}

# Name of listener used for communication between brokers.

# Listener name, hostname and port the broker will advertise to clients.
# If not set, it uses the value for "listeners".
{% if kafka_advertised_listeners is defined %}

# A comma-separated list of the names of the listeners used by the controller.
# If no explicit mapping set in `listener.security.protocol.map`, default will be using PLAINTEXT protocol
# This is required if running in KRaft mode.

# The number of threads that the server uses for receiving requests from the network and sending responses to the network

# The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)
socket.request.max.bytes={{ kafka_socket_request_max_bytes }}


############################# Log Basics #############################

# A comma separated list of directories under which to store log files
log.dirs={{ kafka_data_log_dirs }}

# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across
# the brokers.
num.partitions={{ kafka_num_partitions }}

# The number of threads per data directory to be used for log recovery at startup and flushing at shutdown.
# This value is recommended to be increased for installations with data dirs located in RAID array.
num.recovery.threads.per.data.dir={{ kafka_num_recovery_threads_per_data_dir }}

############################# Internal Topic Settings  #############################
# The replication factor for the group metadata internal topics "__consumer_offsets" and "__transaction_state"
# For anything other than development testing, a value greater than 1 is recommended to ensure availability such as 3.
offsets.topic.replication.factor={{ kafka_offsets_topic_replication_factor }}
transaction.state.log.replication.factor={{ kafka_transaction_state_log_replication_factor }}
transaction.state.log.min.isr={{ kafka_transaction_state_log_min_isr }}

############################# Log Flush Policy #############################

# Messages are immediately written to the filesystem but by default we only fsync() to sync
# the OS cache lazily. The following configurations control the flush of data to disk.
# There are a few important trade-offs here:
#    1. Durability: Unflushed data may be lost if you are not using replication.
#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to excessive seeks.
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
#log.flush.interval.messages=10000

# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
#log.flush.interval.ms=1000

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age
log.retention.hours={{ kafka_log_retention_hours }}

# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log unless the remaining
# segments drop below log.retention.bytes. Functions independently of log.retention.hours.
log.segment.bytes={{ kafka_log_segment_bytes }}

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
log.segment.bytes=1073741824

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according
# to the retention policies
log.retention.check.interval.ms={{ kafka_log_retention_check_interval_ms }}

############################# Timeout #############################

# Offset commit will be delayed until all replicas for the offsets topic receive the commit or this timeout is reached. This is similar to the producer request timeout.
offsets.commit.timeout.ms={{ kafka_offsets_commit_timeout_ms }}
# Max wait time for each fetcher request issued by follower replicas. This value should always be less than the replica.lag.time.max.ms at all times to prevent frequent shrinking of ISR for low throughput topics
replica.fetch.wait.max.ms={{ kafka_replica_fetch_wait_max_ms }}
# The amount of time to sleep when there are no logs to clean
log.cleaner.backoff.ms={{ kafka_log_cleaner_backoff_ms }}

############################# Group Coordinator Settings #############################

# The following configuration specifies the time, in milliseconds, that the GroupCoordinator will delay the initial consumer rebalance.
# The rebalance will be further delayed by the value of group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms as new members join the group, up to a maximum of max.poll.interval.ms.
# The default value for this is 3 seconds.
# We override this to 0 here as it makes for a better out-of-the-box experience for development and testing.
# However, in production environments the default value of 3 seconds is more suitable as this will help to avoid unnecessary, and potentially expensive, rebalances during application startup.
group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms={{ kafka_group_initial_rebalance_delay_ms }}
